/*
 * Adaptation by : Alexandre Gobeaux, Fran√ßois De Keersmaeker, Nicolas van de Walle
 * 
 * This is a hashmap from uint16_t to linkaddr_t. We adapted it from the string
 * generic hashmap cited below.
 * It is permitted to use linkaddr_t instead of uint16_t. However, we assume that those
 * will consist of an array of 2 unsigned chars. (LINKADDR_SIZE = 2) 
 *
 * Originally by Elliot C Back - http://elliottback.com/wp/hashmap-implementation-in-c/
 *
 * Modified by Pete Warden to fix a serious performance problem, support strings as keys
 * and removed thread synchronization - http://petewarden.typepad.com
