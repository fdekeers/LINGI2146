What happens to the children of a mote, when this mote switches parent ?
The route has changed, we thus need to inform root.
	-> Send DIO message, children receive it, and send DAO with new info.

Children that have not sent a DAO message for a too long time are removed from the routing table.

Motes that have not received a DIO message from their parent for a too long time detach themselves from the DODAG, and notify their children.
